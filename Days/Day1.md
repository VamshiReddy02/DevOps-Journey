## DevOps Definition

The simplest Definition is that DevOps is an intersection of Development and Operation.

Let us say you have a great idea about an application, you define its functionality or in other words, what features it will have, you coded and tested it. Now that you have a tested an application and after that you deploy in on a public server, so that end user can access it.
After this, we have to monitor the application, if there is a bug or users facing any issues.

But now, you want make some changes in the application like adding new features or optimize the performance of the application, and we want to make this improvements accessible to the end users immediately. So we make those updates in form of version updates. We repeat this process repeatedly, so this gives us the process of continuous delivery of changes.

DevOps is about making this process of continuous delivery fast with minimal bugs.

## Challenges DevOps tries to solve

### 1) Miscommunication & lack of Collaboration

Lack of Collaboration between developer and Operator  Let us consider, releasing application has two parts. First, developers are responsible for coding and second, operations are responsible for the application. In between these two there might be lack of communication, like developer wrote an application but can't run it or for Operator, running the application but don't know how it work. So developer would code without considering where or how the code will be deployed while operations would try to deploy without really understanding what and why they are deploying or how the application even works and this would result in Miscommunication.

### Confict of interest

In a traditional setup where one team is only responsible for the developments and the other team only for operations, these two have different incentives that make it hard for them to work togather.

### Security

The Security team also evaluates the changes made to make sure it does not affect the system Security, which is a slow process. As we know DevOps is about removing any roadblock that slow down the process.

### application Testing

Similar to the Security team in some project there are separate team or roles for application testing and often these tests are manual when teams cannot rely on their automated tests, which slow down the process.

## Well, by the official definition -

DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity.

So DevOps is not just one set of tools or one specific concept of releasing the software fast and with high quality.

The central part was that development and operations teams should work together more often.

But wait, what on earth does that mean and how does it work in practice?

Since it’s not specific enough so naturally, different companies started implementing DevOps in different ways.
