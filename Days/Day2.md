## Computer Network

### What is Network?
In simple terms, it just means computers connected

## How it all started
In 1957, when the SPUTNIK satellite was launched by Russia. So the US want to create a program to do all the scientific discovery and to keep their country number one. So an agency name Advance Research Project Agency (ARPA) was started by America, and the first satellite was launched within 18 months.

ARPA want to have some sort of a way to communicate with each other. They developed ARPANET, which was considered one of the first computer networks in which the first two nodes, UCLA and SRI(Stanford research institute) then two more added i.e, MIT and University of Utah.

FUN FACT: ARPANET came to India in 1969.

In 1978, the TCP/IP protocol was developed and invented by Bob Kahn for networks, it was developed with help from Vint Cerf.

### Now let's talk about the word 'Protocol'.
Protocol, in computer science, is a set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between electronic devices, such as a computer. For a computer to exchange information, there must be a pre-existing agreement as to how the information will be structured and how each side will send and receive it.
Example: TCP, IP, UDP.
So who creates these rules? ever thought about it.
It's the Internet society that creates these rules on the internet. (https://www.internetsociety.org/)

### How Data is Transferred on Internet?
While using the Internet, the most common protocols are :
• Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
• Internet Protocol (IP)
Usually, they are collectively known as the TCP/IP protocol.
The information which we send through the Internet is broken into packets by TCP using the technique of 'Packet Switching.
Packet Switching is a digital networking communication method which breaks large data into suitably sized blocks, known as Packets.
These packets are wrapped by a wrapper which contains the sender’s address, the receiver’s address and a sequence number.
The IP is responsible for sending these packets to the right address by assigning them a sequence number.
First, the packets are sent to a local Internet Service Provider (ISP).
From here the packets travel through multiple levels of networks, computers and communication lines before reaching the destination.
The packets are sent from different routes to maintain speed.
If a packet could not reach the destination from a route then its route is changed with the help of routers.

### World Wide Web
The world wide web(www), commonly known as the web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by URLs, which may be interlinked by hyperlinks and are accessible over the internet.
