## Client Server Architecture

Before we explain client server architecture and you start reading words such as servers, service, network, data, and files, and start feeling overwhelmed with jargon, let us first understand about this architecture in layperson’s terms.

The notion of client-server architecture can be understood by the analogy of ordering a pizza for delivery. You call the store to order a pizza and someone picks up the call, takes your order, and then delivers it. Simple, right? Yes, this analogy pretty much answers the fundamental principle of client server architecture.

Client server architecture is a computing model in which the server hosts, delivers, and manages most of the resources and services requested by the client. It is also known as the networking computing model or client server network as all requests and services are delivered over a network. The client-server architecture or model has other systems connected over a network where resources are shared among the different computers.

Typically, client server architecture is arranged in a way that clients are often situated at workstations or on personal computers, while servers are located elsewhere on the network, usually on more powerful machines. Such a model is especially beneficial when the clients and server perform routine tasks. For example, in hospital data processing, a client computer can be busy running an application program for entering patient information, meanwhile the server computer can be running another program to fetch and  manage the database in which the information is permanently stored.

## Networking Devices

There are lots of devices which are use to communicate with devices these devices called Networking Devices,There Internal,External or Portable Devices , Internal basically in side the desktop,laptop or mobile like ethernet wifi card or bluetooth if we disconnect our device it does not effect other device until its not in shared devices , External Devices is shared devices every person in a network is using that devices , not directly but indirectly every devices has its importance in a network,Portable Devices battery power device which help to create own network for few hours, using mobile you can create hotspot and allow yours internet share other mobile devices.


### Internal Devices

● Network interface controller (NIC)
● Wireless Network Interface Controller
● Bluetooth Dongle

### External Devices

● Hub
● Switches
● Routers
● Brouters
● Bridges
● Repeater
● Modem
● Gateway
● WIFI-Routers or Broadband Routers


### Gateway

A gateway is not a hardware devices its self , its is software firmware which save configuration setting of a device mostly the gateway address in routers is 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1.
Its acts as a “gate” between two networks. It may be a router, firewall, server, or other device that enables traffic to flow in and out of the network. While a gateway protects the nodes within network, it also a node itself.


### Hubs
A hub is a device to which all devices sharing a physical network can be a physically connected to form a “Local Area Network” or “LAN”. Hubs do little more than enable the electrical currents from a computer sending a packet to pass to all other devices connected to it. Since a hub was the electronic equivalent of shouting in a room as necessary, as the number of devices increased, the number of collisions increased and LAN performance ground to a halt. In a hub-centric environment, the message packets being sent by each device that is connected to the hub can be “seen” by every other device on the hub whether they are involved in the conversation or not. So, hubs can facilitate message eavesdropping.

### Types of Hub
● Active Hub :- These are the hubs which have their own power supply and can clean , boost and relay the signal along the network. It serves both as a repeater as well as wiring center. These are used to extend maximum distance between nodes.
● Passive Hub :- These are the hubs which collect wiring from nodes and power supply from active hub. These hubs relay signals onto the network without cleaning and boosting them and can’t be used to extend distance between nodes.
● Intelligent Hubs :- An intelligent hub can help in troubleshooting by pinpointing the actual location of the problem and help identify the root cause and resolution. It is very adaptable to different technologies without any need to change its configuration. The intelligent hub performs different functions such as bridging, routing, switching and network management.
