## Client Server Architecture

Before we explain client server architecture and you start reading words such as servers, service, network, data, and files, and start feeling overwhelmed with jargon, let us first understand about this architecture in layperson’s terms.

The notion of client-server architecture can be understood by the analogy of ordering a pizza for delivery. You call the store to order a pizza and someone picks up the call, takes your order, and then delivers it. Simple, right? Yes, this analogy pretty much answers the fundamental principle of client server architecture.

Client server architecture is a computing model in which the server hosts, delivers, and manages most of the resources and services requested by the client. It is also known as the networking computing model or client server network as all requests and services are delivered over a network. The client-server architecture or model has other systems connected over a network where resources are shared among the different computers.

Typically, client server architecture is arranged in a way that clients are often situated at workstations or on personal computers, while servers are located elsewhere on the network, usually on more powerful machines. Such a model is especially beneficial when the clients and server perform routine tasks. For example, in hospital data processing, a client computer can be busy running an application program for entering patient information, meanwhile the server computer can be running another program to fetch and  manage the database in which the information is permanently stored.

## Networking Devices

There are lots of devices which are use to communicate with devices these devices called Networking Devices,There Internal,External or Portable Devices , Internal basically in side the desktop,laptop or mobile like ethernet wifi card or bluetooth if we disconnect our device it does not effect other device until its not in shared devices , External Devices is shared devices every person in a network is using that devices , not directly but indirectly every devices has its importance in a network,Portable Devices battery power device which help to create own network for few hours, using mobile you can create hotspot and allow yours internet share other mobile devices.
