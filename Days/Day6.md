## Client Server Architecture

Before we explain client server architecture and you start reading words such as servers, service, network, data, and files, and start feeling overwhelmed with jargon, let us first understand about this architecture in laypersonâ€™s terms.

The notion of client-server architecture can be understood by the analogy of ordering a pizza for delivery. You call the store to order a pizza and someone picks up the call, takes your order, and then delivers it. Simple, right? Yes, this analogy pretty much answers the fundamental principle of client server architecture.
